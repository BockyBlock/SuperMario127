- Powerup music doesn't play on player 2
- Mario is in the air for a bit after getting up from a duck and after a regular dive getup (as in not a dive unroll)
- update position of item under cursor in editor when moving camera [DONE]
- Powerup music overwrites shine sprite jingle 
- Can interact with enemies and players while collecting a shine sprite 
- Chasing demon start animation (like SM64)

Bigger things: 
- Roofskip prevention 
- Ability to place limits on object settings in editor 
- Only attacking at the start of a spin, spin attack hitbox should be bigger and there should be ring particles
- Backflip out of dive
- Pressing confirm on the settings menu doesn't save the settings which is rather unintuitive
- Ability to make big steelies despawn after a timer [Will require major changes]
