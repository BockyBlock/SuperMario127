# Super Mario 127 Public Repository
 As of the 0.8.0 update, the SM127 legacy codebase is public and free to clone and use wherever you need!


Note:
- Just want to play the game? Download a pre-built release from the [itch.io page](https://charpurrr.itch.io/super-mario-127).
- Looking to create mods? Download the source code for the latest stable release from the [releases page](https://github.com/Level-Share-Square/SuperMario127/releases).

While this may seem counter-intuitive, the master branch is used for ongoing development of the game and is not guaranteed to be fully functional. Please only use the master branch if you wish to contribute to development or test out new features. Thank you!


### How to set-up SM127 using Godot 3.6:

- Download Godot 3.6 from [here](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/3.6-stable/). While you could attempt to transition the project from Godot 3 to Godot 4, we do not recommend it.
- Download the repository as zip, or fork the repository then clone it using the git software of your choice.
- Through Godot, open the `project.godot` file found in the source code.

  From there, you are free to edit the project as you wish!
